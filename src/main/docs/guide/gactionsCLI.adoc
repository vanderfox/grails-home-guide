We will use `gactions CLI` to test our app. 

Go to https://developers.google.com/actions/tools/gactions-cli[gactions CLI] and download it:

Make the gactions binary executable (chmod +x on linux and OSX).

After you have installed gactions, run the init command in your terminal:


[source, bash]
----
$ gactions init --force
----


Other commands you can run: preview, update, deploy, test, and list.

Since we have already included an action.json file, we just want to set up your account information and we will come back to this later.
