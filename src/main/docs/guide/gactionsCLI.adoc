We will use `gactions CLI` to test our app. 

Go to https://developers.google.com/actions/tools/gactions-cli[gactions CLI] and download it:

Make the gactions binary executable (chmod +x on linux and OSX).

After you have installed gactions, run the init command in your terminal:


[source, bash]

$ gactions init --force
