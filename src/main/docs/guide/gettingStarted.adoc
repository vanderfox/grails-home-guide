In this guide you are going to learn how to create a Grails application to host a https://developers.google.com/actions/[Google Action] for your https://madeby.google.com/home/[Google Home] device to interact with. We will build, deploy, and setup everything necessary to facilitate this on https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/[Google Appengine Flexible] and Google APIs.

We will be using the https://github.com/frogermcs/Google-Actions-Java-SDK[early access unofficial Java SDK] to build actions. This is because the only official SDK is build with node.

Later we will show you can also integrate with the gui based service to build actions at http://api.ai[API.ai] and integrate Grails with webhooks.
