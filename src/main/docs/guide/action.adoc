This is the metadata to tell google actions about our app.

We will need to modify projectId with the one you created in the console, and the httpExecution items to match your deployed application endpoints.

Here you can also control:

    * sample queries to help google understand which action to call
    * intent to call
    * reference for new schema at https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/rest/Shared.Types/ActionPackage
